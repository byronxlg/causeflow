# Butterfly Effect

## Project description

## Inspiration behind the project

This project was inspired by Price Wars by Rupert Russell, a book that shows how seemingly isolated events—like food shortages or political decisions—are really the outcome of long chains of causes stretching across markets, nations, and time. That idea stuck with me: we often know what has happened, but rarely stop to ask why it happened, or what events set the stage.

With today’s flood of breaking news and headlines, people are overwhelmed by “what” but lack accessible tools to trace back the “why.” I wanted to build something that makes cause-and-effect visible and intuitive—turning complex, hidden chains of events into an engaging visual story. The project aims to help anyone, not just experts, explore how history unfolds into the present moment and see the deeper patterns behind the news.
